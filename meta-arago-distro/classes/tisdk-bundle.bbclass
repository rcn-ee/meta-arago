Manifest template 1.0

This template is used to generate an unloadable manifest to the SRAS. To do so, save the document as a plain text file (Save As .txt). Do not change any options on the save which means leave the default as Windows Default Encoding. The SRAS will generate a nice looking HTML manifest for you.

Instructions:

 1.   Text in blue should not be edited or removed. It will NOT appear on your manifest.
 2.   DO NOT color outside the lines in the manifest.  There are specific blocks where you enter information. Information
       should only be entered in the sections below and not outside of them.
 3.   DO NOT use the < or > symbols in your manifest table or in your footnotes.
 4.   Please REFRAIN from using Word specific formatting when filling in the table. Examples are things like superscripts,
      subscripts, etc. We are unable to understand those.
 5.   Auto correction is not your friend in word. Please turn it off. It should be disabled already in this template.

Table Instructions:

Define what you are delivering by filling in the table below. Tables start with the start keyword <table> end with the end keyword, </table> and may also contain footnotes specific to that table.

You can have as many .Public. tables as you like in your manifest and can name them.  You can have one and only one .Private. table. To create additional tables copy everything starting with <table> down to </table> and then paste it after the table below.

The field .attribute =. can be set to Public (the default) or Private to define the type of table it is. If the table is Public then everything in the table will appear on your manifest. If the table is Private then none of the entries will appear on your manifest but they will be stored in the SRAS. Private tables are useful for documenting third party code, that requires Legal review, but does not need to be acknowledged on the manifest you ship; e.g. it may be covered by our TI license.

The field .name = . is used to put a heading over the table on the manifest you ship.

The field .description =. is used to put a description under the Table name on the manifest you ship.

To learn how to document software in the table read the instructions here. A brief explanation of the table columns follows.
License Type - If its an SPDX defined license use their short name identifier. You can see a list here: http://spdx.org/licenses/ . If it.s not on the list and not a commercial or TSPA  license then use the application name as the license.

Delivered As - This field will either be .Source., .Binary. or .Source and Binary. and is the form the content of the Software is delivered in.  If the Software is delivered in an archive format, this field applies to the contents of the archive. If the word Limited is used with Source, as in .Limited Source. or .Limited Source and Binary. then only portions of the Source for the application are provided.

Modified by TI - This field will either be .Yes. or .No.. A .Yes. means TI has made changes to the Software. A .No. means TI has not made any changes. Note: This field is not applicable for Software .Obtained from. TI.

Location - The directory name and path on the media, e.g. drive, (or in an archive) where the Software is located after installing or extracting.

Obtained From - This field specifies from where or from whom TI obtained the Software. It may be a URL to an Open Source site, a 3rd party licensor, or TI (if TI developed the software). If this field contains a link to Open Source software, the date TI downloaded the Software is also recorded. See Links Disclaimer in the Disclaimers Section.

GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION

Version 3.1, 31 March 2009

Copyright © 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. http://fsf.org/

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This GCC Runtime Library Exception (Exception) is an additional permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version 3 (GPL-3.0). It applies to a given file (the Runtime Library) that bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that the file is governed by GPL-3.0 along with this Exception.

When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.
0. Definitions.

A file is an Independent Module if it either requires the Runtime Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based on the Runtime Library.

GCC means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any subsequent versions published by the FSF.

GPL-compatible Software is software whose conditions of propagation, modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with the license of GCC.

GPL-compatible Software is software whose conditions of propagation, modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with the license of GCC.

The Compilation Process transforms code entirely represented in non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example, use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be understood as starting with the output of the generators or preprocessors.

A Compilation Process is Eligible if it is done using GCC, alone or with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an Eligible Compilation Process.
1. Grant of Additional Permission.

You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPL-3.0, provided that all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice, consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.
2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.

The availability of this Exception does not imply any general presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft requirements of the license of GCC.
